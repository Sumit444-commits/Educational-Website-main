## 1. Home Page

### Usability

- The old homepage lacked a structured introduction or a compelling call to action.
- Navigation felt generic and didn’t draw users toward important areas.
-  Improved: The new version greets users with a clean hero section, clear navigation links, and purposeful CTAs that guide the user effectively through the site.

### Interface Design

- Previously cluttered with no clear visual flow.
-  Improved: Clean layout with properly spaced sections, minimal distractions, and intuitive design elements.

Color Enhancements

- Old site used inconsistent colors and low contrast.
-  Improved: Harmonious color palette with accent tones for CTA buttons and headings.

### Typography

- Inconsistent and small font sizes made reading difficult.
-  Improved: Uniform fonts, clear hierarchy between headings and body text, and enhanced readability.

### Navigation Improvements

- *Old:* Navigation bar had minimal styling and no hover effects, making it unclear which page was active.
-  *New:* The navbar now features hover states, active link indicators, and better spacing. It's sticky too — so users can navigate from anywhere on the page.

### Responsiveness

- *Old:* The homepage wasn’t optimized for mobile — images and texts overlapped, and menus were unusable on smaller screens.
-  *New:* Fully responsive layout — hero banners scale properly, text reflows neatly, and mobile menu is accessible and intuitive.

### Visual Content

- *Old:* Static content with little to no visual engagement — lacked imagery or dynamic media.
-  *New:* High-quality visuals and icons are now integrated, making the homepage more lively and engaging. Banner images communicate the site’s purpose instantly.
